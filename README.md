# SimplePaperMCDownloader
Simple (and my first) shell script to download Minecraft Server file and setup automatically.

## How to use
Download main.sh and execute it.

`./main.sh` `bash main.sh` `sh main.sh` or someting.

First, the script ask for download link of Server File. Copy the download link and paste it. (Maybe other bukkit can be supported but i tested with only paper.)

And type the ram you want to use.

Script will download bukkit in 'mcserver' sub directory and modify eula.txt.

After that, go to mcserver/ and execute server.sh, the bukkit will start.

## why u made this
idk

i was lazy to download bukkit everytime
